Data::Passphrase
================

This mod_perl module provides interfaces for checking passphrase
strength against a set of customizable rules.  Procedural and
object-oriented Perl interfances, an HTTP service, and a trivial form
handler are included.

An application or user may submit the passphrase to be checked via the
query parameter "passphrase".  The module also supports a "username"
parameter, which defaults to $r->user().  Sites may wish to configure
rules to check passphrases based on user-related data, so the
"username" parameter may be useful for testing.

The response consists only of an HTTP response code and status
message.  If a passphrase is deemed to weak via a certain rule, the
error code associated with that rule is returned.  Usually, these
error codes are in the 4xx range.  If a passphrase passes all rules,
200 is returned.

This module supports GET and POST request methods, but POST is usually
appropriate to avoid passphrases being recorded in server logs.
